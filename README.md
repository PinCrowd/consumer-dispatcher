#The Consumer Dispatcher Project

Consumer Dispatcher works as a proxy between [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) and your consumers. Let you scale out and maintain consumers easily.

[The netcircle](www.thenetcircle.com) has been using it for more than 18 months. It helps us to consume more than 6 million jobs per day with around 25M memory and 2%cpu usage.
